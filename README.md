### 💥 💥  UNINSTALL SCRIPT / Removal of Config Files
- 11 March 2025, due to popular request, created a guided `uninstall.sh` script. USE this with caution as it may render your system unstable.
- I will not be responsible if your system breaks
- The best still to revert to previous state of your system is via `timeshift or snapper`

#### ✨ for ZSH and OH-MY-ZSH installation
> installer should auto change your default shell to zsh. However, if it does not, do this
```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```
- reboot or logout
- by default `agnosterzak` theme is installed. Which is from external oh-my-zsh theme. You can find more themes from this [`OH-MY-ZSH-THEMES`](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes)
- to change the theme, `SUPER SHIFT O` , choose  desired theme, and close and open terminal. 
- or manually edit `~/.zshrc` . Look for ZSH_THEME="desired theme"

#### ❗ some known issues for nvidia
- reports from members of my discord, states that some users of nvidia are getting stuck on sddm login. credit  to @Kenni Fix stated was 
```  
 while in sddm press ctrl+alt+F2 or F3
log into your account
`lspci -nn`, find the id of your nvidia card
`ls /dev/dri/by-path` find the matching id
`ls -l /dev/dri/by-path` to check where the symlink points to 
)
```
- add "env = WLR_DRM_DEVICES,/dev/dri/cardX" to the ENVvariables config `~/.config/hypr/UserConfigs/ENVariables.conf`  ; X being where the symlink of the gpu points to

- more info from the hyprland wiki [`Hyprland Wiki Link`](https://wiki.hyprland.org/FAQ/#my-external-monitor-is-blank--doesnt-render--receives-no-signal-laptop)


- reports from a member of discord for Nvidia for additional env's
- remove # from the following env's on 
```
env = GBM_BACKEND,nvidia-drm
env = WLR_RENDERER_ALLOW_SOFTWARE,1
```

#### ❗ other known issues
- [ ] If you are using this script on an Arch-Based distros like Arco linux, or cachy OS or EOS or Manjaro, make sure to install pipewire, pipewire-pulse & pipewire-audio first. Arco Linux, on some of their ISO's still shipped with pulseaudio as audio backend. You will experience getting "stuck" on installation.
- [ ] To install pipewire and its services , `sudo pacman -S pipewire wireplumber pipewire-audio pipewire-pulse` . When prompted, remove / replace pulseaudio. After that, you can ran `./install.sh`
- [ ] installing of cava-git on a newly installed Arch makes the install keep hanging. Switched back to cava. After booting and logged in, if cava dont work, replace it cava-git `yay -S cava-git` or `paru -S cava-git` 
> [!NOTE]
> Auto start of Hyprland after login (no SDDM or GDM or any login managers)
- [ ] This was disabled a few days ago. (19 May 2024). This was because some users, after they used the Distro-Hyprland scripts with other DE (gnome-wayland or plasma-wayland), if they choose to login into gnome-wayland for example, Hyprland is starting. 
- [ ] to avoid this, I disabled it. You can re-enable again by editing `~/.zprofile` . Remove all the # on the first lines
- [ ] ROFI issues (scaling, unexplained scaling etc). This is most likely to experience if you are installing on a system where rofi is currently installed. To fix it uninstall rofi and install rofi-wayland . `sudo pacman -Rns rofi` . Install rofi-wayland with `sudo pacman -S rofi-wayland`. Rofi-wayland is compatible with x11 so no need to worry.
